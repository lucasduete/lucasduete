## About me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer and Technical Leader** based in Brazil, currently working at **Tensai**, building large-scale systems for **data collection and statistical analysis**.

My day-to-day work lives at the intersection of:
- backend architecture,
- database performance and data modeling,
- system scalability and reliability,
- and pragmatic engineering decisions that survive production.

I also write regularly about **how I actually work** — from PostgreSQL tuning and backend trade-offs to homelabs, self-hosting, and productivity as a tech lead.

## Writing & projects

**Dev blog:** https://lucasduete.dev  

Some topics I write about:
- PostgreSQL performance tuning (indexes, batch queries, VACUUM, real EXPLAIN analysis)
- Backend architecture and trade-offs
- Self-hosting & homelab (Proxmox, Docker, observability, networking)
- Productivity systems and workflows for senior engineers and tech leads
- Remote-first development environments
